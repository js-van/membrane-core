defmodule Membrane.Element.Manager.Source do
  @moduledoc """
  Base module to be used by all elements that are sources, in other words,
  elements that produce the buffers. Some examples might be: a file reader,
  a sound card input.

  ## Callbacks

  As for all base elements in the Membrane Framework, lifecycle of sinks is
  defined by set of callbacks. All of them have names with the `handle_` prefix.
  They are used to define reaction to certain events that happen during runtime,
  and indicate what actions frawork should undertake as a result, besides
  executing element-specific code.

  ## Actions

  All callbacks have to return a value.

  If they were successful they return `{:ok, actions, new_state}` tuple,
  where `actions` is a list of actions to be undertaken by the framework after
  the callback has finished its execution.

  Each action may be one of the following:

  * `{:buffer, {pad_name, buffer}}` - it will cause sending given buffer
    from pad of given name to its peer.
  * `{:caps, {pad_name, caps}}` - it will cause sending new caps for pad of
    given name.
  * `{:event, {pad_name, event}}` - it will cause sending given event
    from pad of given name to its peer.
  * `{:message, message}` - it will cause sending given message to the element's
    message bus (usually a pipeline) if any is defined,

  ## Demand

  If Element.Manager has source pads in the pull mode, the demand will be triggered
  by sinks. The `handle_demand/2` callback will be then invoked but
  should not return more than one buffer per one `handle_demand/2` call.
  In such case, if Element.Manager is holding more data than for one buffer,
  the remaining data should remain cached in the element's state and released
  upon next `handle_demand/2`.

  If Element.Manager has source pads in the push mode, it is allowed to generate
  buffers at any time.

  ## Example

  The simplest possible source Element.Manager that has pad working in the pull mode,
  looks like the following:

      defmodule Membrane.Element.Manager.Sample.Source do
        use Membrane.Element.Manager.Base.Source

        def_known_source_pads %{
          :source => {:always, :pull, :any}
        }

        # Private API

        @doc false
        def handle_demand(_pad, state) do
          # Produce one buffer in response to demand
          {:ok, [
            {:buffer, {:source, %Membrane.Buffer{payload: "test"}}}
          ], state}
        end
      end

  Callback that is called when buffer should be produced by the source.

  It will be called only for pads in the pull mode, as in their case demand

  For pads in the push mode, Element.Manager should generate buffers without this
  callback. Example scenario might be reading a stream over TCP, waiting
  for incoming packets that will be delivered to the PID of the element,
  which will result in calling `handle_other/2`, which can return value that
  contains the `:buffer` action.

  It is safe to use blocking reads in the filter. It will cause limiting
  throughput of the pipeline to the capability of the source.
