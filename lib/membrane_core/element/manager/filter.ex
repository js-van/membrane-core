defmodule Membrane.Element.Manager.Filter do
  @moduledoc """
  Base module to be used by all elements that are filters, in other words,
  elements that process the buffers going through them. Some examples might be:
  an MP3 decoder, a video resizer.

  ## Callbacks

  As for all base elements in the Membrane Framework, lifecycle of sinks is
  defined by set of callbacks. All of them have names with the `handle_` prefix.
  They are used to define reaction to certain events that happen during runtime,
  and indicate what actions frawork should undertake as a result, besides
  executing element-specific code.

  Sinks have a callback that will be core to their operations in all sane cases:
  `handle_process/3` which gets called when data is available and should be
  processed. Usually then filter returns `:buffer` action which causes to send
  buffers to the subsequent elements.

  ## Actions

  All callbacks have to return a value.

  If they were successful they return `{:ok, actions, new_state}` tuple,
  where `actions` is a list of actions to be undertaken by the framework after
  the callback has finished its execution.

  They are combination of actions that can be returned by sources and sinks,
  and each action may be one of the following:

  * `{:buffer, {pad_name, buffer}}` - it will cause sending given buffer
    from pad of given name to its peer. Pad must be a source pad.
  * `{:caps, {pad_name, caps}}` - it will cause sending new caps for pad of
    given name.
  * `{:demand, pad_name}` - it will cause sending request for more buffers to
    the pad of given name.
  * `{:event, {pad_name, event}}` - it will cause sending given event
    from pad of given name to its peer. Pad may be either source or sink pad.
  * `{:message, message}` - it will cause sending given message to the element's
    message bus (usually a pipeline) if any is defined,

  ## Demand

  Please note however, that if it has source pads in the pull mode, which are
  triggered by demand coming from sinks, the `handle_process/3` callback
  should not return more than one buffer per one `handle_demand/2` call.
  In such case, if upstream Element.Manager has sent more data than for one buffer,
  the remaining preprocessed data, or postprocessed buffers made out of it
  (whatever is more appropriate in case of the particular element) should
  remain cached in the element's state and released upon next `handle_demand/2`.

  The real-life scenario might be parsing a MP3 file read from the
  hard drive. File source for each demand will output one buffer which will
  contain e.g. 16kB of data. It will be sent to the parser which splits it
  into MP3 frames. Each 16kB chunk will contain many frames, but parser should
  output only one and keep rest in cache. When next demand request arrives,
  parser should release frame in cache and do not trigger reading more data
  from the file. Only when cache is empty it should ask file reader for more
  data. In such way we do not generate excessive throughput.

  ## Example

  The simplest possible filter Element.Manager working in the pull mode may look like
  the following. It gets buffers from upstream (we assume buffers' payload
  are strings), splits them into individual letters and send these individual
  letters as buffers:

      defmodule Membrane.Element.Manager.Sample.Filter do
        use Membrane.Element.Manager.Base.Filter

        def handle_demand(_pad, %{cache: cache} = state) do

              # Request more data if the cache is empty
              # FIXME potential race condition - we forward demand and new
              # demand comes faster than we process and process returns twice
              {:ok, [
                {:demand, :sink}
              ], state}

              {:ok, [
                {:buffer, {:source, item}}
              ], %{state | cache: new_cache}}
          end
        end

        @doc false
        def handle_process(_pad, %Membrane.Buffer{payload: payload}, %{cache: cache} = state) do
          # Process one buffer from upstream, split it into individual letters
          # that will be later sent upon each demand request.
          new_cache =
            payload
            |> String.split
            |> Enum.reduce(cache, fn(item, acc) ->
              :queue.in(acc, item)
            end)

          # Because it is impossible that process happens without prior demand
          # we should send at least one item.
          # FIXME potential race condition
          {{:value, item}, new_cache} = :queue.out(new_cache)

          {:ok, [
            {:buffer, {:source, item}}
          ], %{state | cache: new_cache}}
        end
      end
